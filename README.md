# Out Of Date as of June 2022
My current dotfiles are wildly different from when this was uploaded.

I will not be uploading them however, as they are heavly copied from others works and I do not wish to call them my own.

For my recomendation on a nice desktop configuration, check out [Peux OS](https://peux-os.netlify.app/twms/) specifically their wayfire edition.
